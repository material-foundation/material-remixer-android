 * The Remixer Application sets up Remixer.

 * <b>There are two things that must be initialized:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Register an instance of RemixerActivityLifecycleCallbacks for lifecycle callbacks, this
 *   ensures no leaks happen since it removes all RemixerItems associated with an activity when the
 *   latter is destroyed</li>
 *   <li>Sets the synchronization mechanism for Remixer, this tells Remixer what logic to use to
 *   keep values in sync. In this example we're using simple local-only syncing with no
 *   persistence.</li>
